# Scene Recognition Using Deep Learning

## Libraries Used - 
- matplotlib
- numpy
- pandas
- tensorflow (only for pre-processing)

## Steps to run - 
1. The project requires the dependencies to be present. All the relevant commands needed 
are present in the `Makefile` to create conda environment. 
2. Project also contains the required `environment.yml` for the relevant dependencies. 
3. Please run `make setup` to create conda environment. 
4. Run `conda activate deep-learning-scene-recognition` to activate the environment.
5. Run python file `python3 model.py` to run the Model. The program will start and will perform the following operation
  - Downloading the dataset
  - Data preprocessing
  - Model building
  - Model fitting and tuning
  - Performance and printing
